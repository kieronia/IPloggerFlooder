# IPloggerFlooder

Ever been sent a harmful link that logs your ip upon clicking it? This floods that link with different requests from different proxies - (ips)

This means that hundreds of random ips will show up when they try and check their results.

Wouldn't of been possible without https://github.com/DeadBread76/IP-Logger-spammer - this should be a faster / smoother program hence why I made it
